# Guide on How to Use Cogs in This Template

## Guide

1. Start by either copying the folder [Test](https://github.com/NovaProtocol/DisnakeBotTemplate/tree/master/src/cogs/Test) or by making a folder of your own. Copying is a stress-free way to setup a new cog but if you want to learn how to create your own, feel free to continue this.

   If you copied, skip to Step 5.

2. If you created your own folder, start by making a cog.py file in that folder. This will contain the loader of all the files you would use in that cog.
